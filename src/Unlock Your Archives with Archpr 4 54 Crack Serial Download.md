## Step 1: Download and install ARCHPR
 
You can download ARCHPR from the official website of Elcomsoft Co.Ltd., the developer of the software[^3^]. The trial version allows you to recover passwords up to four characters long. To unlock the full functionality, you need to purchase a license key. After downloading the setup file, run it and follow the instructions to install ARCHPR on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Launch ARCHPR and select the archive file
 
Open ARCHPR and click on the "Open" button to browse for the archive file that you want to crack. You can also drag and drop the file into the program window. ARCHPR supports ZIP, 7Zip and RAR formats, as well as some other types of archives. The program will automatically detect the type of encryption used in the archive and display it in the "Encryption" field.
 
## Step 3: Choose the attack method and set the options
 
ARCHPR offers four types of attacks to recover passwords: brute-force, mask, dictionary and known-plaintext. You can select one of them from the "Attack" menu. Each attack has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the complexity and length of the password. Here is a brief overview of each attack:
 
- Brute-force: This method tries all possible combinations of characters until it finds the correct password. It is guaranteed to work, but it can take a very long time if the password is long or complex.
- Mask: This method is similar to brute-force, but it allows you to specify a pattern or a mask for the password, such as "a??b?c". This can reduce the search space and speed up the recovery process if you know some parts of the password.
- Dictionary: This method uses a list of words or phrases as possible passwords. It is faster than brute-force, but it only works if the password is a common word or phrase.
- Known-plaintext: This method requires you to have a file that is identical to one of the files inside the archive. It uses this file as a reference to decrypt the archive and find the password. It is very fast and effective, but it only works if you have such a file.

After choosing an attack method, you can set some options for it by clicking on the "Options" button. For example, you can specify the character set, the password length range, or the dictionary file for each attack. You can also enable or disable some features, such as smart mutations, GPU acceleration or distributed processing.
 
## Step 4: Start the recovery process and wait for the result
 
When you are ready, click on the "Start" button to begin the recovery process. ARCHPR will display a progress bar and some statistics, such as speed, time elapsed and time remaining. You can pause or stop the process at any time by clicking on the corresponding buttons. You can also save or load a recovery project by clicking on the "Project" menu.
 
If ARCHPR finds the correct password, it will show it in a pop-up window and in the "Password" field. You can then copy it to your clipboard or use it to open or extract the archive file.
 
## Conclusion
 
Advanced Archive Password Recovery 4.54 is a powerful tool that can help you recover passwords from encrypted ZIP, 7Zip and RAR archives. It supports various types of attacks and options to optimize your chances of success. However, it is not a magic solution that can crack any password instantly.
